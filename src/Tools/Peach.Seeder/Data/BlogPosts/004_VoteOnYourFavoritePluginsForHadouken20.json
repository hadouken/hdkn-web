  "content": "I've added a [Trello board][1] where you folks can vote on your favorite plugins and/or comment on them with suggestions on what could improve. I will accept a plugin as \"needed\" when it gets 10 votes or more, at which I will move it to the \"To Do\" list.

I will add more plugins as I come up with ideas for them, and if you feel that a plugin is missing, just post a comment on here with what kind of functionality you're looking for.

Enjoy!
