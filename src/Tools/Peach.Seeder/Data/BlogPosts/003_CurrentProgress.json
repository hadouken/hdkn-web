  "content": "If you've been following me on GitHub you'd know that progress is being made. One of the things I'm working on right now is the different plugins - the torrent plugin takes a lot of my time since it is the most complex.

Apart from plugins, the core is almost ready. It needs some stability enhancements and plugin validations, but all in all, it works as expected and I can focus on writing the core plugins of which there will be four.

 * Config - provides a key/value store service.
 * Events - a SignalR hub which publishes events to clients.
 * Torrents - the big BitTorrent plugin which enables all BitTorrent downloads.
 * WebUI - provides the GUI for plugins to build upon. If you want a really slick Hadouken installation you could in theory disable this plugin and only communicate with Hadouken over JSONRPC since the WebUI is just that - a web-based user interface.
 * Plugin repository - builds upon the WebUI and adds a way to browse, install and update plugins from within your own Hadouken web interface.

As soon as we hit the release button for 2.0, plugins will have their own release cycle and fixes will be published as bugs are fixed and features developed.

Since the web-based UI builds upon Twitter's Bootstrap framework I'll make sure to have it mobile-friendly from start so you can easily remote manage your Hadouken instance.

If you have any questions or feature requests - just send me a comment!"
