  "content": "So I've been having a quiet winter and christmas. Haven't been doing all that much Hadouken development the last month, but that's changed now. I've fixed plugin updating and I'm getting closer to releasing 2.0. The stuff that's missing is mostly UI related. The core is stable enough for a beta release some time soon.

The new website is also more than halfway done and will probably be released the coming weeks or so.

Also, Hadouken needs a new logotype so I'm looking for someone who knows how to make a sleek icon which will be revealed at the time 2.0 is released! E-mail me at viktor@viktorelofsson.se or just comment on this post and we'll talk :)

For now."
