        <h4><i class="fa fa-github"></i> Open source</h4>
        <p>
            We believe in open source and so should you. <a href="https://github.com/hadouken/hadouken">The source code for Hadouken</a>
            is hosted on GitHub and includes everything needed to build it yourself.

        <h4><i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece"></i> Plugins, plugins and plugins</h4>
        <p>
            In Hadouken, plugins are first-class citizens. In fact, we believe so much in plugins that
            much of the core functionality is implemented as plugins. Plugins are easy to install and
            maintain, and we have loads of them!

    <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h4><i class="fa fa-group"></i> Community driven</h4>
        <p>
            It is the community that makes Hadouken so frickin' awesome. Ideas, plugins and general epicness
            all comes from the community. We &lt;3 you.
        </p>
        
        <h4><i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i> No ads, no bullshit</h4>
        <p>
            We aim to make you happy, and that is why you will never see ads on this site, in the installer
            or in the web interface. We also do not try to shove crapware and toolbars down your throat.
